# Student Daily Checklist, Timers, and Progress Monitoring App

## Overview
This web-based application is an instructional support tool designed to help a high-school student with executive-functioning needs manage daily assignments, track time on task, and build independence.

The app mirrors the student’s paper-based intervention plan while adding structure, consistency, and documentation features that support school, home, and IEP progress monitoring.

The application runs in a web browser and may be used at school or at home on a Chromebook, laptop, or desktop computer.

## Key Features

### 1. Daily Class Checklist
For each scheduled class period, the student can:
- Write the assignment or task
- Check:
  - ✅ Done
  - 📤 Submitted
  - 🆘 Needs Help

### 2. Class-Period Timers
Each class includes a built-in timer that:
- Tracks active work time
- Reinforces time awareness
- Supports IEP goals related to sustained attention and task completion

Timers can be started, paused, or reset as needed.

---

### 3. Focus Timer
A separate focus timer allows the student to:
- Work in short, manageable intervals
- Practice goal-directed work habits
- Receive gentle reminders and clear stopping cues

This supports self-regulation and reduces task avoidance.

---

### 4. End-of-Day Reflection
At the end of the day, the student confirms:
- What was finished
- What was submitted
- What still needs to be done

Optional student and adult signatures reinforce accountability and communication.

### 5. One-Click Printable PDF
The app can generate a printable form that:
- Mirrors the school’s intervention checklist

This ensures continuity between digital and paper-based systems.

### 6. Weekly Summary for IEP Progress Monitoring

- Total time on task by class

This summary supports:

Weekly notes may be copied, printed, or saved for records.

### 7. Share / Email Feature
At the end of the day, the student or adult can:
- Generate a written daily summary
